# Lab 2: JavaScript Frameworks

## Overview

This project serves as a simple lab to learn about module export, import, and the use of functions from imported modules in JavaScript. It demonstrates basic concepts of modular programming and showcases several utility functions to perform common operations.

## Project Structure

- **`index.js`**: The main entry point of the application. It imports utility functions and demonstrates their usage.
- **`utility.js`**: A module containing various utility functions used in the project.

## Features

### 1. Print a Welcome Message
The `printMessage` function takes a first name and last name as parameters and prints a personalized greeting.

### 2. Inch to Centimeter Conversion
The `inchToCm` function converts inches to centimeters. It takes a measurement in inches and returns the equivalent in centimeters.

### 3. BMI Calculation
The `getBmi` function calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) given a weight in kilograms and a height in meters.

### 4. Sum of an Array
The `sumValues` function takes an array of numbers as input and returns the sum of those numbers.
